# Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration:
A User-Friendly Tool Using Streamlit and Plotly
Using Github Cloning, Python, Pandas, MySQL,mysql-connector-python, Streamlit, and Plotly.

# The learning outcomes of this project:

1. Data extraction and processing: You will learn how to use Clone Github to
extract data from a repository and pre-process the data using Python libraries
such as Pandas.
**2. Database management:** You will learn how to use a relational database such
as MySQL to store data and retrieve it efficiently for analysis and visualization.
**3. Visualization and dashboard creation:** You will learn how to use libraries
such as Streamlit and Plotly to create interactive and visually appealing
dashboards for data visualization.
**4. Geo visualization:** You will learn how to create and display data on a map
using Plotly's built-in geo map functions.
**5. Dynamic updating:** You will learn how to create a dashboard that
dynamically updates based on the latest data in a database.
**6. Project development and deployment:** You will learn how to develop a
comprehensive and user-friendly solution, from data extraction to dashboard
deployment. You will also learn how to test and deploy the solution to ensure it
is secure, efficient, and user-friendly.
